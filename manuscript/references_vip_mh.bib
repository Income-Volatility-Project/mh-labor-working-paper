abstract = {Abstract We investigated the consequences of interview and social-evaluative workplace anxiety on job performance, and whether these two anxieties share a common antecedent–fear of negative evaluation. Job applicants (n = 128) completed a survey following their interview and halfway through their work term; supervisory performance ratings were collected at the end of the work term. Fear of negative evaluation was positively correlated with both interview anxiety and social-evaluative workplace anxiety. The correlation between interview anxiety and job performance was near zero, as was the correlation between social-evaluative workplace anxiety and job performance; these relations were not moderated by the social-evaluative nature of the job. This study suggests that anxious interviewees and employees perform as well as their less anxious counterparts, even in social-evaluative jobs.},

This study evaluates the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) as a measure for diagnosing and monitoring depression.
Methods
We assessed construct validity in a cross-sectional sample of 1619 medical outpatients (mean age 43±14 years, 64% female) by comparing the PHQ-2 to four longer self-report questionnaires. Criterion validity was established in a subsample of 520 participants with reference to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). Sensitivity to change was investigated in a prospective study of 167 patients who completed the SCID both at baseline and the 1-year follow-up.
Results
With reference to the SCID, the PHQ-2 had a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 78% for major depressive disorder and a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 86% for any depressive disorder. Its diagnostic performance was comparable with that of longer depression scales. PHQ-2 change scores accurately reflected improved, unchanged, and deteriorated depression outcomes.
Conclusion
The PHQ-2 performed favorably with respect to a standard diagnostic interview, as well as established depression scales and proved sensitive to change. Thus, the PHQ-2 appears promising as a brief multipurpose measure for detecting depression, grading its severity, and monitoring outcomes over time.}

abstract = {Poverty remains one of the most pressing problems facing the world; the mechanisms through which poverty arises and perpetuates itself, however, are not well understood. Here, we examine the evidence for the hypothesis that poverty may have particular psychological consequences that can lead to economic behaviors that make it difficult to escape poverty. The evidence indicates that poverty causes stress and negative affective states which in turn may lead to short-sighted and risk-averse decision-making, possibly by limiting attention and favoring habitual behaviors at the expense of goal-directed ones. Together, these relationships may constitute a feedback loop that contributes to the perpetuation of poverty. We conclude by pointing toward specific gaps in our knowledge and outlining poverty alleviation programs that this mechanism suggests.}

abstract = {Anxiety is linked to increased avoidance and inhibition, whereas depression is linked to decreased approach and diminished behavioral activation. Although these notions are widely recognized, systematic investigation of approach-avoidance tendencies is lacking across these diagnostic groups. Participants (mean age = 45.6; 65.8% female) were subdivided in healthy controls (405), remitted patients (877) and currently anxious (217), depressed (154) or comorbid (154) patients. Automatic approach-avoidance tendencies in reaction to facial expression were assessed using the Approach-Avoidance-Task (AAT). Self-reported trait approach and avoidance tendencies were assessed using the BIS/BAS scale. Severity of psychopathology was assessed to examine dose-response relationships. We did not find any consistent associations of automatic approach-avoidance tendencies with psychiatric variables. In contrast, medium to large differences in BIS scores showed increased trait avoidance tendencies in all patient groups relative to healthy controls. Overall, it seems that increased trait avoidance, rather than decreased approach, is a characteristic of affective disorders. This holds for both depressed and anxious patients and more strongly so in severe and chronic patients. It underlines the importance to address trait avoidance tendencies in the treatment of affective disorders.}

This Series paper summarises evidence regarding the epidemiology on gender differences in prevalence, incidence, and course of depression, and factors possibly explaining the gender gap. Gender-related subtypes of depression are suggested to exist, of which the developmental subtype has the strongest potential to contribute to the gender gap. Limited evidence exists for risk factors to be specifically linked to depression. Future research could profit from a transdiagnostic perspective, permitting the differentiation of specific susceptibilities from those predicting general psychopathologies within and across the internalising and externalising spectra. An integration of the Research Domain Criteria framework will allow examination of gender differences in core psychological functions, within the context of developmental transitions and environmental settings. Monitoring of changing socioeconomic and cultural trends in factors contributing to the gender gap will be important, as well as the influence of these trends on changes in symptom expression across psychopathologies in men and women.},

But is this incentive argument strong enough in practice to prefer unproductive workfare to even untargeted cash transfers? A nonparametric survey-based method is used to assess the cost-effectiveness of a large workfare scheme in a poor state of India with high unemployment. Forgone earnings are evident but fall short of market wages. For the same budget, unproductive workfare has less impact on poverty than either a basic-income scheme or transfers tied to the government's assignment of ration cards. The productivity of workfare is thus crucial to its justification as an antipoverty policy.},

	abstract = {Governments around the developing world face pressure to intervene actively to help jobseekers find employment. Two of the most common policies used are job training, based on the idea that many of those seeking jobs lack the skills employers want, and job search assistance, based on the possibility that even if workers have the skills demanded, search and matching frictions make it difficult for workers to be hired in the jobs that need these skills. However, reviews of the first generation of evaluations of these programs found typical impacts to be small, casting doubt on the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of these programs. This paper re-examines the arguments for whether, when, and how, developing country governments should undertake job training and job search assistance policies. We use our experience with policy implementation, and evidence from recent impact evaluations, to argue that there is still a role for governments in using these programs. However, success depends critically on program design and delivery elements that can be difficult to scale effectively, and in many cases the binding constraint may be a lack of firms with job openings, rather than a lack of workers with the skills to fill these openings.},

Mental disorder diagnosis between ages 15 and 25 was used as the exposure. The level of education, employment status, annual wage or self-employment earnings, and annual total income between ages 25 and 52 (measurement years 1988–2015) were used as the outcomes. Results All serious mental disorders were associated with increased risk of not being employed and not having any secondary or higher education between ages 25 and 52. The earnings for individuals with serious mental disorders were considerably low, and the annual median total income remained rather stable between ages 25 and 52 for most of the mental disorder groups. Conclusions Serious mental disorders are associated with low employment rates and poor educational outcomes, leading to a substantial loss of total earnings over the life course.},

The more effective intervention averted 9 months of depression on average over five years and cost only \$66 per recipient. Therapy changed people’s beliefs about themselves in three ways. First, it reduced their likelihood of seeing themselves as a failure or feeling bad about themselves. Second, when faced with a novel work opportunity, therapy reduced over-optimistic belief updating in response to feedback and thus reduced overconfidence. Third, it increased self-assessed levels of patience and altruism. Therapy did not increase levels of employment or consumption, possibly because of other constraints on employment in the largely female study sample.},

	type = {Working Paper},
	abstract = {Mental health conditions are prevalent but rarely treated in low- and middle-income countries ({LMICs}). Little is known about how these conditions affect economic participation. This paper shows that treating mental health conditions substantially improves recipients’ capacity to work in these contexts. First, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) ever conducted that evaluate treatments for mental ill-health and measure economic outcomes in {LMICs}. On average, treating common mental disorders like depression with psychotherapy improves an aggregate of labor market outcomes made up of employment, time spent working, capacity to work and job search by 0.16 standard deviations. Treating severe mental disorders, like schizophrenia, improves the aggregate by 0.30 standard deviations, but effects are noisily estimated. Second, we build a new dataset, pooling all available microdata from {RCTs} using the most common trial design: studies of psychotherapy in {LMICs} that treated depression and measured days participants were unable to work in the past month. We observe comparable treatment effects on mental health and work outcomes in this sub-sample of highly similar studies. We also show evidence consistent with mental health being the mechanism through which psychotherapy improves work outcomes.},

	abstract = {Major depressive disorder ({MDD}) is one of the most prevalent mental illnesses worldwide. Existing evidence suggests that it has both economic causes and consequences, such as unemployment. However, depression has not received significant attention in the economics literature. In this paper, we present a simple model which predicts the core symptoms of depression from economic primitives, i.e. beliefs. Specifically, we show that when exogenous shocks cause an agent to have pessimistic beliefs about the returns to her effort, this agent will exhibit depressive symptoms such undereating or overeating, insomnia or hypersomnia, and a decrease in labor supply. When these effects are strong enough, they can generate a poverty trap. We present descriptive evidence that illustrates the predicted relationships.},

Individual-level registry data from Denmark show that these disorders carry large earnings penalties, ranging from 34 percent for depression and 38 percent for {BD} to 74 percent for schizophrenia. To investigate the causal effects of mental health on a person’s career, we exploit the approval of lithium as a maintenance treatment for {BD} in 1976. Baseline estimates compare career outcomes for people with and without access in their 20s, the typical age of onset for {BD}. These estimates show that access to treatment eliminates one third of the earnings penalty associated with {BD} and greatly reduces the risks of low or no earnings. Importantly, access to treatment closes more than half of the disability risk associated with {BD}.},

Similarly, negative economic shocks cause mental illness, and antipoverty programs such as cash transfers improve mental health.

	abstract = {In spite of high levels of poverty in low and middle income countries ({LMIC}), and the high burden posed by common mental disorders ({CMD}), it is only in the last two decades that research has emerged that empirically addresses the relationship between poverty and {CMD} in these countries. We conducted a systematic review of the epidemiological literature in {LMIC}, with the aim of examining this relationship. Of 115 studies that were reviewed, most reported positive associations between a range of poverty indicators and {CMD}. In community-based studies, 73\% and 79\% of studies reported positive associations between a variety of poverty measures and {CMD}, 19\% and 15\% reported null associations and 8\% and 6\% reported negative associations, using bivariate and multivariate analyses respectively. However, closer examination of specific poverty dimensions revealed a complex picture, in which there was substantial variation between these dimensions. While variables such as education, food insecurity, housing, social class, socio-economic status and financial stress exhibit a relatively consistent and strong association with {CMD}, others such as income, employment and particularly consumption are more equivocal. There are several measurement and population factors that may explain variation in the strength of the relationship between poverty and {CMD}. By presenting a systematic review of the literature, this paper attempts to shift the debate from questions about whether poverty is associated with {CMD} in {LMIC}, to questions about which particular dimensions of poverty carry the strongest (or weakest) association. The relatively consistent association between {CMD} and a variety of poverty dimensions in {LMIC} serves to strengthen the case for the inclusion of mental health on the agenda of development agencies and in international targets such as the millenium development goals.},
